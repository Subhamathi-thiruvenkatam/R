## A Time Series Dive into Berlin's Air Quality
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This R code is all about taking a deep dive into the air quality of Berlin. As a student, I got my hands on some time series analysis on harmful air pollutants from 2010 to 2020. Here's a quick breakdown:

Data Loading:

I loaded data for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Nitrogen Monoxide (NO) for each year.
Used the sf package to play around with spatial data.
Plotted the chosen air quality station on the Berlin map.

Time Series Plots:

Created line plots to see how NO2, O3, and NO concentrations changed over the years.
Merged all the plots into one grid, showing the changes in air pollutants over the decade.

Correlation Matrix:

Calculated a correlation matrix to see if these pollutants are buddies or not.
Visualized it as a heatmap using a pretty color gradient for visualization using ggplot2.

This code is for understanding how air quality fluctuates in Berlin. It's me experimenting out trends and connections between different pollutants. 

## The Accident Analysis Package
I created this beginner R package called "Accidentanalysis." As a student, I was all about experimenting with data analysis, and a brief note on the package is that it contains five different in-built functions that can be used in the package.

The in-built functions:
1.Severity Analysis Plot:

Dug into accident data to analyze how severe things got.
Created a bar plot by district

2.Hourly Distribution Plot:

Explored when accidents tend to happen during the day.
Made a histogram to visualize the hourly distribution â€“ peak accident times identification

3.Vehicle Involvement Analysis:

Investigated the impact of the number of vehicles on accident severity.
Summary statistics and a bar plot was created for analysis.

4.Day-of-Week Analysis:

Checked out how accidents are distributed throughout the week.
Here a scatterplot is created to visualize the distribution

5.Dataset Loading:

Included a function to load the accident dataset from a CSV file


This package is a way of tackling real-world problems â€“ accidents, in this case. It's not just about coding; it's about gaining insights. And yes, I had fun experimenting with R and data exploration.
